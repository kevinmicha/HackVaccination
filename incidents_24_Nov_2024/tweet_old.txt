🔍💉 Let's set the record straight on vaccines! Vaccines undergo rigorous testing to ensure their safety and efficacy before they are authorized for use. According to multiple studies, the known side effects of COVID-19 vaccines like those from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna are largely rare and well-documented.

The recent study highlighted that their benefits in preventing severe disease far outweigh these rare risks. Medical experts emphasize that the scientific consensus is clear: vaccines are safe, effective, and crucial in our fight against diseases like COVID-19, polio, and measles.

Misinformation can lead to hesitancy and risks for all of us. It's essential to rely on trusted sources of information about vaccine safety. Let's prioritize facts over fear!
